An additional uncertainty arises from saturation profiling, which discerns between pores filled with brine and pores filled with CO2 above a poorly constrained level of saturation (Arts et al., 2004). It follows from the commonly used Gassmann equation (Gassmann, 1951) that: (a) very low saturations of less than a few percent are undetectable; (b) a strong correlation emerges as the gas saturation increases from a few percent to around thirty percent; and (c) for saturations much above thirty percent, it is difficult to distinguish between moderate and high saturations. It follows that the 80% gas saturation that is commonly assumed for the Sleipner plume, while reasonable (Chadwick et al., 2005; Bickle et al., 2007), remains uncertain (Lumley, 2008). If the 80% assumption represents a reasonable upper limit to the mean saturation for the plume, the lower limit could be as low as 40%, halving mass balance estimates premised on the widely assumed high-saturation value.

Quantitative imaging analysis revealed that approximately 78 ± 0.6% of cells were Sox17-positive on D5 and approximately 88 ± 1.1% of cells were AFP-positive on D13 and approximately 29 ± 0.9% of cells were ALB-positive on D20 (Fig. 3D). The ALB secretion in the media of differentiated FAP-specific iPS cells on D20 was approximately 20 μg/ml (Fig. 3E). Moreover, these D20 differentiated FAP-specific iPS cells were also periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive, indicating cytoplasmic glycogen storage (Fig. 3F). These results clearly indicated that FAP-specific iPS cells had the potential to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells.

There is a red-shift in the solid state CD spectrum of GMP compared with its liquid CD spectrum. The negative band about the conformation of the sugar moiety has nearly disappeared. In solid-state, mutarotation is more difficult and the negative band at the 260 nm nearby can be detected which indicates that the GMP ligand is mainly β-anomers. In the spectrum of complex 1, the weak negative band at 215–225 nm indicates that the GMP exists as l-ribo [5], which is induced by the strong π–π and hydrogen bonding interaction. For solid samples, CD spectroscopy is highly sensitive to even a very small distortion from planarity of the aromatic chromophore [12]. The strong negative CE centered at 297 nm (θ ≈ − 10 mdeg) is due to the excitation coupling of π → π* transitions of the aromatic chromophores, including the intra- and intermolecular coupling of the guanine chromophores [13], which is consistent with the single crystal structure.
