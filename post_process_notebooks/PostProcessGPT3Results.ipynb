      "Original Para: The brief peak in Apectodinium, AOM and low salinity dinoflagellate cysts (Deflandrea) at 2617.4 m (Fig. 7) indicate a sporadic episode of surface water freshening/eutrophication before the CIE, which is best explained by an increase in regional precipitation due to its rapid nature. A coincident reduction in I. hiatus swamp conifers indicates possible disturbance of nearby coastal environments possibly from flooding (see Section 4.5). An associated reduction in δ13C may have been caused by stratification of the North Sea from an enhanced halocline, trapping 12C-enriched organic carbon at depth. This scenario may also explain the other peaks in Apectodinium at 2619.6 and 2614.7 m (although see Section 4.1).\n",

      "Original Para: Lithology in the CTBI includes interbedded shales, clays and mudstones, some of which are pyritiferous. The organic matter in the black shales is of marine origin, but includes a significant fraction of terrigenous material (Forster et al., 2008). The black shales are highly laminated and relatively undisturbed by bioturbation. The δ13Corg record is incomplete due to poor core recovery and low sample yield, but an excursion signifying OAE 2 is recorded: a 0.5‰ VPDB negative shift immediately precedes the 4‰ positive excursion, −27.7 to −23.7‰ (Fig. 2; Supplementary Material, Table 1f; Forster et al., 2008). The characteristic excursion spans ∼2 m of finely interbedded shales and mudstones. Throughout OAE 2, the δ13Corg values fluctuate between ∼−23.5‰ to −27.5‰. The maximum enrichment in the δ13Corg is at 1035.75 mbsf, ∼3.52 m into OAE 2 (Forster et al., 2008).\n",

      "Original Para: Thermodynamic modelling using MTDATA software was undertaken in addition to pilot scale tests, in a bid to improve understanding of the likely compounds and associated phase formation of elements under carbonation and calcination conditions. Modelling was undertaken for 4 major elements (C, Ca, O, and H) and up to 9 minor elements (Ba, Cd, Cr, K, Mg, Ni, Sr, Ti, and Zn) based on those which are considered to be most volatile, have the greatest negative impact on the environment and health, and which were present in the highest quantities in the limestone as identified by ICP-MS analysis as outlined in Table 2, in order to investigate partitioning behaviour under pilot scale CO2 capture conditions. The multiphase module of MTDATA was used in the modelling, combined with the Scientific Group Thermodata Europe (SGTE) database, in order to predict compound/phase formation for the complete temperature range, from temperatures of 600 °C, up to 750 °C for carbonation and 1000 °C for calcination, in steps of 20 °C, and at atmospheric pressure. Molar quantities, based on ICP-MS analysis of the limestone, for each of the elements being investigated were entered into the model.\n",

      "Original Para: SEM–EDS analysis of sorbent sampled from the carbonator after each test was undertaken to determine the percentage weight of the elemental species present. The results as shown in Fig. 8 confirm that increasing bed inventory generally increases the presence of Al, Fe and Cu. Al was identified in the unreacted sample at a weight% of 0.34, but this increased to similar values of 0.67% and 0.66% for 4.5 kg and 6 kg samples respectively, with a much higher value of 3.98% for 13 kg sample of sorbent. This increase in Al% weight with increasing sorbent mass may be because there is a greater amount of Al present originally, or because the limestone acts as a sorbent for Al, which is also considered the case for Fe and Cu. Further, Al is likely to form Ca aluminates which are important constituents of cement. The EDS results indicate similar quantities of C, O and Ca between tests, although values for the samples that had undergone testing are slightly lower for C and O, and slightly higher for Ca, compared to the unreacted limestone sample, implying that the small change was a result of chemical reactions. Although the values are small, a steady decrease in Si weight% was recorded with increasing sorbent mass, implying removal of Si from limestone in the capture process. However the lowest value was recorded for the unreacted limestone.\n",

      "Original Para: Flybys E12 and E13 (middle and right panels of Fig. 2) were nearly identical in terms of the flyby geometry, directly above the north pole of the moon with a minimum distance of only 50 km. Cassini was slightly downstream of the moon during encounter E12 and slightly upstream during E13. The details of the measurements for those two flybys are shown in Fig. 4. Intensities of electrons with different energies and look directions are shown in detail in the upper four panels on a linear scale. The lower two panels show the measured local pitch angle (115° during E12 and about 75° for E13) of the low-energy telescope of MIMI/LEMMS and the azimuthal component of the measured magnetic field Bϕ. We use sometimes the Bϕ component as an index of field-aligned current perturbations in the system. Such currents may exist in the Alfvén-wing system or represent discontinuities as predicted by Saur et al. (2007). Discontinuities in Bϕ could be useful in identifying the location where Cassini was magnetically connected to the surface of Enceladus. The intensities for electrons with tens to hundreds keV energies (e.g. in channel C3) show a “ramp”- or step-like depletion (marked by red and green areas in Fig. 4A) before or after the deep absorption signature. The electron intensity drops gradually or sometimes in two steps from magnetospheric levels to background levels. It is interesting that the sharp ramps are mostly seen in the sub-Saturn upstream and in the anti-Saturn downstream region. This may be coincidence and has to be checked during the upcoming encounters for consistency.\n",

Calculations with data from different LEMMS channels give similar results. Calculations are done at constant first adiabatic invariant (μ = Esin2α(E + 2mc2)/(2mc2B)). Conservation of the second invariant is questionable, since a bounce for 170° pitch angle electrons takes about 15 s.

As discussed in Section 3.2 (and shown for R15 in Fig. 6) the temperatures may be regarded as representing to within ±50 K exospheric and H3+ temperatures. While the values are based on equinox simulations, we found seasonal differences to be insignificant, generating temperature changes of ⩽10 K.

      "Original Para: The temperature changes with electron energy flux depend on the electric field strength that was set. For a moderate field strength of 80 mV m−1 the temperature is virtually constant when increasing the energy flux from 0.2 to 1.2 mW m−2, while at E = 100 mV m−1 it increases from ∼550 K to 850 K. Thus we can make the more general statement that for low to moderate electric field strength Saturn’s thermospheric temperatures are more responsive to changes in electric field strength than incident energetic electron flux of 10 keV particles. Temperatures are less responsive to changes in energy flux for soft (500 eV) electrons (not shown) as these do not penetrate deep enough into the atmosphere to significantly affect Pedersen and Hall conductances (Galand et al., 2011).\n",

      "Original Para: A further finding from the upper panel of Fig. 12 relates to possible restrictions on combinations of electric field strength and 10 keV electron energy flux. The bottom left half of the figure (below the thick red line) represents a range of observed temperatures on Saturn (400–650 K) and thus of “allowed” combinations of electric field strength and particle flux. In contrast, combinations of these two magnetospheric forcing parameters that result in temperatures in the top right part of the figure (above the red line) need to be treated with caution as they produce temperatures in excess of observations. A magnetospheric electric field of ∼100 mV m−1 mapped into the ionosphere would in combination with at 10 keV electron flux of 1 mW m−2 generate thermosphere temperatures of ∼800 K, well in excess of observed values. This combination of values cannot thus occur for extended periods on Saturn.\n",

      "Original Para: K10 demonstrated that absorption by hydrogen in the extended thermosphere of HD209458b explains the transits in the H Lyman α line, and used the observations to constrain the mean temperature and composition of the thermosphere. They fitted both the line-integrated transit depth based on the low resolution G140L data (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2004; Ben-Jaffel and Hosseini, 2010), and the transit depths and light curve based on the medium resolution G140M data (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2003; Ben-Jaffel, 2007, 2008) (see Figs. 5 and 6 of K10 for the results). The results imply that the lower boundary of the absorbing layer of H is at p0 = 0.1–1 μbar, the mean temperature within the layer is T¯=8000–11,000K, and the upper boundary is at r∞ = 2.7Rp. Recent photochemical calculations imply that H2 dissociates near the 1 μbar level (e.g., Paper I, Moses et al., 2011), and this is also supported by an observational lower limit for the vertical column density of H (France et al., 2010). Hence the mean temperature in the thermosphere of HD209458b is approximately 8250 K (the M7 model of K10).\n",

      "Original Para: Fig. 4 shows the density profiles of H, H+, O, and O+ from the C2 model, and the density profile of H from the M7b model. The difference between the transit depths based on the empirical and hydrodynamic models arises because the C2 model has large temperature gradients (Paper I) and a gradual H/H+ transition rather than a sharp cutoff. The difference does not arise because the density profile of the C2 model deviates from hydrostatic equilibrium. Given the temperature gradient in the model, the density profile is almost exactly in hydrostatic equilibrium below 3Rp. In fact, the neutral density profile of the C2 model is better represented by a mean temperature of 6300 K (not shown). This implies that the correspondence of the mean temperature of the empirical model and the pressure averaged temperature of the hydrodynamic model is relatively good but not exact.\n",

      "Original Para: Salts are relevant to the habitability of Mars. First, perchlorate reduction is a metabolism used by some terrestrial bacteria in anaerobic conditions (Coates and Achenbach, 2004). If such organisms exist (or did exist) on Mars, then they could gain energy by reducing perchlorate and oxidizing an electron donor such as organic carbon or ferrous iron. This would require organic molecules to be present on Mars. Indigenous organic molecules have yet to be confirmed on Mars; however the presence of perchlorate itself may have inhibited the detection of organics on Mars in pyrolysis experiments (Navarro-Gonzalez et al., 2010). Second, perchlorate salts are highly deliquescent and significantly lower the freezing point of liquid water (Gough et al., 2011). The eutectic point of Mg(ClO4)2 is −57 °C (Stillman and Grimm, 2011), while that of Ca(ClO4)2 is −75 °C (Pestova et al., 2005). Given typical soil salt concentrations, small amounts of water (∼0.02 g H2O per g soil) would permit a water activity sufficient for terrestrial life to be viable (Kounaves et al., 2010b). Third, if all organisms require fixed nitrogen in proteins and nucleic acids, as they do on Earth, then the discovery of nitrogen oxyanions on Mars would be significant as well.\n",

      "Original Para: The purpose of the sensitivity tests was not to model a physically plausible environment on Mars; however, the tests revealed that no one factor could perturb the nominal model to produce amounts of perchlorate that approach the amount measured by the Phoenix Lander. A combination of such factors, including reduced odd nitrogen fluxes, higher oxygen mixing ratios, and increased temperatures may have worked in concert to produce larger perchlorate:nitrate ratios. Specifically, if odd nitrogen downward fluxes and oxygen escape rates are smaller than currently thought, nitrate fluxes would drop while perchlorate fluxes would increase. In conjunction, as the surface temperature warms toward 280 K (as it does in the current equatorial summer) local perchlorate production fluxes could increase further. While it is possible to tweak the photochemical model into this mode, it is difficult to imagine a self-consistent scenario where all of these processes are working in concert to create high perchlorate:nitrate and perchlorate:chloride ratios on Mars, so we favor an additional source for perchlorate.\n",

      "Original Para: In addition to the topography images, the Peak Force tapping AFM measurements also provide information on nano-scale mechanical properties of the surface, i.e., deformation, adhesion, dissipation, and elastic modulus. The images in Fig. 5 show the nano-mechanical properties of the different surfaces, obtained simultaneously with the topography images in Fig. 4, respectively. The calculated mean values of each mechanical property image for the adsorbed Mefp-1 films before and after exposure to the FeCl3 solution are provided in Table 2. The property images in Fig. 5 and mean values in Table 2 show that the Fe3+ enhanced complexation of the adsorbed Mefp-1 film results in less deformation, a slightly lower adhesion force between the tip and the adsorbed protein film, and a lower energy dissipation as the tip is tapping over the surface. The DMT modulus data are fitted values from curves obtained as the tip is retracted after the initial deformation, which is a measure of the surface hardness. The results clearly show that Fe3+ complexation of the adsorbed Mefp-1 film results in a large increase in the modulus (average value from 38 MPa to 185 MPa).\n",

Let Ein be an execution of the timer's input port Si,i and Eout an execution of its output port TimeT,s,C. Then Eout∈ΦTime(Ein), iff the following holds:–(Clock) Clock C is correct at all times, i.e., t′−t⩽C(t′)−C(t)⩽ϑ(t′−t) for all t,t′∈R, t<t′.–(Reset) There exists a (binary) signal σT,s,C∈[TimeT,s,C] (the equivalence class of the output port's signal) such that, for each time ts∈R when Si,i switches to state s, there is a time t∈[ts,ts+dTime] such that (T,s,C) is reset, i.e., event (0,t)∈σT,s,C. This is a one-to-one correspondence, i.e., for each such ts this time t is unique and (T,s,C) is not reset at any other times.–(Expire) Denote by R⊂R the set of times when (T,s,C) is reset. For each time tR∈R, denote by tE(tR) the unique time satisfying that C(tE(tR))−C(tR)=T. Then, for each t∈R, TimeT,s,C(t)=0 iff t∈⋃tR∈R[tR,tE(tR)). Iff (tE(tR),1)∈TimeT,s,C, i.e., (T,s,C) is not reset during (tR,tE(tR)] again and hence TimeT,s,C switches to 1 at time tE(tR), we say that (T,s,C) expires at time tE(tR). (T,s,C) is expired at time t∈R iff TimeT,s,C(t)=1. For notational convenience, we will omit the clock C and simply write (T,s) for both the timeout and its signal.\n",

      "Original Para: UK prevalence estimates for tinnitus are relatively dated; data for the widely cited National Study of Hearing (NSH) [2] were collected in the 1980's. It is possible that prevalence figures may have changed since then, for example, due to more recreational noise exposure. In addition, neither the NSH nor any other large-scale, population-based study has provided comparisons between tinnitus and neuroticism. The objectives of this study were to provide a detailed description of the prevalence of tinnitus in a large population study of UK adults aged 40 to 69 years, according to age and sex, (following on from a previous study [5]), as well as to examine the link between tinnitus severity and neuroticism.\n",

      "Original Para: An off-white powder, Mg3NF3 (1) was successfully synthesised at 1323 K. Initial powder diffraction measurements produced a pattern that matched the ICDD database entry (PDF Card number 25-0517). Indexing of the peaks gave a cubic unit cell with a=4.2153(4) Å, which is in good agreement with the literature value of 4.216 Å [3]. Longer PXD scans revealed the presence of a small impurity of the MgF2 reagent, which was included as a secondary phase in the final cycles of the refinement and refined to a final phase fraction of 1.1(2) wt%. Given the similarity in form factor for isoelectronic N3− and F−, obtaining a definitive structure for 1 in which partial site disorder could be categorically discarded from PXD data alone was not possible. PND data were collected to address this problem as there is sufficient contrast in the coherent neutron scattering lengths to allow a convincing solution to be obtained (N: b=9.36 fm, F: b=5.65 fm) [28]. Starting from the refined PXD model, the refinement progressed smoothly and converged to produce a good fit to the data. Attempts to refine occupancies of the anion sites to investigate possible N/F disorder reduced the quality of the fit, increased R-factors and caused some parameters to become unstable, indicating an ordered model in which N3− occupies only the 1b (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) site and F− the 3d (1/2, 0, 0) site to be correct. The details of the both PXD and PND refinements can be found in Table 1. Important interatomic distances can be found in Table 2. A fitted profile plot for the PND data for the backscattering bank (〈2θ〉=145°) is shown in Fig. 1. (Additional refinement fits and a table of anisotropic thermal displacement parameters can be found in the Supplementary information.)\n",

Mg3NF3 is cubic (space group: Pm3m) and has a structure related to rock-salt MgO, but with one cation site vacant. Mg2NF is tetragonal (space group: I41/amd) and has an anti-LiFeO2 related structure. Both compounds are essentially ionic and form structures in which nitride and fluoride anions are crystallographically ordered. The nitride fluorides show temperature independent paramagnetic behaviour between 5 and 300 K.\n",
