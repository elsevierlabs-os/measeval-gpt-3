Instructions for running the MeasEval paragraphs through OpenAI's GPT-3 API

- Make sure you are in a Python environment with the openai library installed
      - pip install openai
- Install the transformers library so we can get token counts on out promts
      - pip install transformers

create a keyset for the paragraphs you want to submit
update the measEvalDriver.py to point at the correct files/locations
    -  keys - the file names of the paragraphs you want to submit
    -  paraBasePath - directory where the paragraphs are located
    -  basePromptPath - prompt file to use with the paragraphs
    -  resultsFilePath - file name to place the results

I recommend breaking large numbers of paragraphs into smaller sets of keys - in case there are issues with GPT-3 you don't waste credits.

Afterward you'll need to convert the JSON response into TSV format for scoring
